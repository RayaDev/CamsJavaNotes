Polymorphism is the ability to work with several types as if they were the same type. 
Moreover, the objects' behavior will be different depending on their type.

    The healCat() method can accept Lion, Tiger, and Cheetah objects â€” they're all instances of Cat:
    
    So our Dolittle class works with different types as if they were the same type. 

    Now let's tackle the second part: "moreover, the objects' behavior will be different depending on their type".
    
    Polymorphism does more than just let us use different types as one. 
    It also lets us remember their differences, preserving the behavior specific to each of them.
